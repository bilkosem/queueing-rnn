**Queueing Recurrent Neural Network (Q-RNN)** is a new kind of Artificial Neural Network that has been designed to use in time-series forecasting applications. According to experiments that have been run, QRNN mostly outperforms the LSTM, Simple RNN and GRU, in the cases where the dataset has highly non-linear characteristics.
