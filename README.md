# Queueing Recurrent Neural Network (Q-RNN) [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

**Queueing Recurrent Neural Network (Q-RNN)** is a new kind of Artificial Neural Network that has been designed to use in time-series forecasting applications. According to experiments that have been run, QRNN has a potential to outperform the LSTM, Simple RNN and GRU, in the cases where the dataset has highly non-linear characteristics.

## What is Q-RNN? 🤔

(Hossam Abdelbaki (2020). rnnsimv2.zip (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/91-rnnsimv2-zip), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved September 22, 2020.)

It is a compose of Simple RNN and [Random Neural Network](https://github.com/bilkosem/random_neural_network). Queueing RNN uses the fundamental math of Queueing Theory and G-Queues while combining it with the powerful architecture of Recurrent Neural Networks. For more detailed explanation about the theoretical background of QRNN check the [mathematical-model](https://github.com/bilkosem/queueing-rnn/tree/master/mathematical-model) folder, and references section. 

## Comparison 📊

In order to evaluate the performance of QRNN, it has been compared with LSTM, GRU and Simple RNN using Keras with TensorFlow backend. During the experiments, 4 different data sets ([google stock price](https://www.kaggle.com/medharawat/google-stock-price), [bike sharing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset), [pm2.5 concentration](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data), [traffic volume](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)) and 10 different optimization algorithms have been used. The mean square error distribution on the test set is given in the image below. As it seems QRNN manages to reach 3 lowest rms error out of 4.
